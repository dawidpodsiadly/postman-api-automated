# API Testing with Postman and Jenkins

## About The Project:
This project is focused on automating API testing using Postman 👩‍🚀 and running the tests through Jenkins. The project includes a custom-built API server that is used for testing API endpoints. There are 52 API tests, structured in a special way to ensure easy testing and organization.

### Test Structure:
The Postman tests are organized into a specific structure:

```
├── Setup
│   ├── Create Admin Auth Token
│   ├── Create Not Admin Auth Token
├── /auth
│   ├── GET /auth
│   │   ├── Should return 401 when Invalid Token - GET /auth
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── POST /auth
│   │   ├── Should return 401 when Invalid Credentials - POST /auth
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── /users
│   ├── Setup
│   │   ├── Generate random User Data
│   ├── GET /users
│   │   ├── Should return 200 and Contain User IDs as Admin User - GET /users
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── POST /users
│   │   ├── Should return 200 and Create new User as Admin User - POST /users
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- Each folder represents an endpoint (e.g., /auth, /users).
- Under each endpoint folder, there are subfolders for each HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
- Under each HTTP method folder, there are subfolders for tests that check different scenarios related to that endpoint and method.

### Dynamic Data:
- Every time the tests are executed, data is generated randomly to simulate a variety of scenarios and ensure thorough testing. The generated data is stored in collection variables, making it accessible for subsequent requests.

### Running Postman Tests Using Jenkins:
- Jenkins manages the entire process in a single pipeline:
     - The API server is automatically started before the tests.
     - The Postman tests are executed via Newman once the server is running.
     - All logs, including those from the API server and test results, are captured and available in Jenkins for review during the pipeline run.

This approach ensures that both the API server and the Postman tests are handled automatically within the same pipeline run, streamlining the testing process and avoiding manual intervention.

## How to Run:
### Locally:
1. Install dependencies for the API server using `cd api-server && npm install`.
2. Start the server with `node server.js`.
3. Run Postman tests manually or using Newman `cd postman-api-tests && npx newman run postman-collection.json`.

### In Jenkins:
1. Create pipeline script from scm and pass correct data to repository
2. Build Now
